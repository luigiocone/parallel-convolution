# Parallelizing the Convolution Operation using MPI

Project work for "Sistemi concorrenti" course at Unisannio. This repository was forked from [0xnirmal/Parallel-Convolution-MPI](https://github.com/0xnirmal/Parallel-Convolution-MPI) and the documentation about the convolution operation has been moved in [docs](https://github.com/luigiocone/Parallel-Convolution-MPI/tree/master/docs) folder.

The goal of this project is to optimize the convolution operation in order to minimize the execution time. All changes must be made taking into account the machine's specs on which the program will run.
